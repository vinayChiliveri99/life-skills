# Prevention of Sexual Harassment Answers

**1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?**

Sexual harassment can manifest in various forms, and it's important to recognize that these behaviors can be unwelcome and create a hostile or uncomfortable environment. The three main forms:

- *Verbal Harassment:*
  - Comments about clothing, appearance, or body.
  - Sexual or gender-based jokes or remarks.
  - Threats.

- *Visual Harassment:*
  - Posters, drawings, or pictures of a sexual nature.

- *Physical Harassment:*
  - Sexual assault.
  - Inappropriate touching.

**2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?**

If I were in a situation where I face or witness such incidents, I would:

- Speak up directly to the harasser, clearly stating that the behavior is unwelcome.
- Document incidents, noting dates, times, and individuals involved.
- Report the harassment to a supervisor or manager, following company procedures.
- Utilize company reporting mechanisms, such as HR or ethics hotlines.
- Seek support from trusted colleagues and prioritize mental well-being throughout the process.

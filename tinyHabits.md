BJ Fogg intriduced this formula B = MAP, to explain the elements involved in making new habits. 
  - M stands for Motivation.
  - A stands for Ability.
  - P stands for Prompt.
Identify and break the behaviour you want to achive into small pieces, have a action prompt to get reminded and celebrate the small achievements.

# Learning Process

#### 1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

The Feynman Technique is a four-step learning method that are teaching a concept in simple terms, identifying gaps in understanding, reviewing the source material, simplifying explanations to enhance comprehension.

#### 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea from this "Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley" video is the concept of two modes of thinking:

a) **The Focus mode** and b) **The Diffuse mode**. 

The difference between them is explained by using a pinball machine on how these modes work. 
* The Focus mode involves: 
  - concentrated, familiar thinking. 
* The Diffuse mode allows:
  -  for a more relaxed and wide-ranging thinking process.
  
The video suggests that effective learning involves switching between these two modes and highlights techniques like the Pomodoro Technique,
testing oneself, and the importance of practice and repetition for mastering material.

#### 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

1. Active Modes of Thinking -
   * Active mode involves with focused attention on a specific task or concept.
   * Active mode is ideal for familiar or well-known information, such as historical patterns or multiplication tables.
   * Thinking is concentrated, focused, and follows predetermined mental paths.

2. Diffuse Mode of Thinking:
    * Diffuse mode is defined by a relaxed set of neural states.
    * It is activated when dealing with new, unfamiliar thoughts, concepts, or problems.
    * This allows thoughts to range widely, making connections and exploring new ideas.
    * Very useful for gaining a new perspective and experience with new concepts.
    * This mode operates in the background while relaxing, which helps for creative problem-solving.
    * Diffuse mode is helpful when transitioning from familiar ideas to new ideas of unexplored territories of thought.

#### 4.According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

According to the video, The first 20 hours -- how to learn anything, the steps to take when approaching a new topic are:

1. Deconstruct the Skill:
   - Break down the skill into smaller pieces.
2. Learn Enough to Self-Correct:
   - Gather 3 to 5 resources about the skill to enable self-correction during practice.
3. Remove Barriers to Practice:
   - Eliminate distractions and external factors that stop focused practice.
4. Practice for at Least 20 Hours:
   - Commit to practicing the skill for a minimum of 20 hours to overcome initial frustration and see significant improvement.

#### 5.What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

Some actions that I can take in my learning process are:
- Setting realistic goals.
- Using Feynman Technique to effortlessly learn and master concepts.
- Teaching others and having effective communication.
- Continuously improving and making the learning journey enjoyable and fun!

# Learning Process 

**1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**

The Feynman Technique is a four-step learning method that are:
    1. Teaching a concept in simple terms.
    2. Identifying gaps in understanding. 
    3. Reviewing the source material. 
    4. Simplifying explanations to enhance comprehension.


**2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea from this "Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley" video is the concept of two modes of thinking: 
a) **The Focus mode** and b) **The Diffuse mode**. 

The difference between them is explained by using a pinball machine on how these modes work. 
    * The Focus mode involves: 
        - concentrated, familiar thinking. 
    * The Diffuse mode allows:
        -  for a more relaxed and wide-ranging thinking process.
  
The video suggests that effective learning involves switching between these two modes and highlights techniques like the Pomodoro Technique,
testing oneself, and the importance of practice and repetition for mastering material.


**3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

1. Active Modes of Thinking -
   * Involves focused attention on a specific task or concept.
   * Comparable to playing a pinball game where thoughts follow established pathways.
   * Ideal for familiar or well-known information, such as historical patterns or multiplication tables.
   * Thinking is tight, focused, and follows pre-established mental pathways.

2. Diffuse Mode of Thinking:
    * Characterized by a relaxed set of neural states.
    * Similar to the pinball game analogy, with widely spaced rubber bumpers.
    * Activated when dealing with new, unfamiliar thoughts, concepts, or problems.
    * Allows thoughts to range widely, making connections and exploring new ideas.
    * Useful for gaining a new perspective and grappling with innovative concepts.
    * Operates in the background during relaxation, facilitating creative problem-solving.
    * Helpful when transitioning from familiar ideas to new, unexplored territories of thought.

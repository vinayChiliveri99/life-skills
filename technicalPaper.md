# Data Warehousing

## Definition

Data Warehousing (DW) is a process for collecting and managing data from various sources to provide meaningful business insights.

- A Data Warehouse is used to connect and analyze business data from multiple sources.
- The data warehouse is the core of the Business Intelligence (BI) system, used for data analysis and reporting.
- Data Warehousing is not a product but an environment.

## How Data Warehouse Works

A Data Warehouse works as a central repository where information arrives from one or more data sources. Data flows into a data warehouse from the transactional system and other relational databases.

Data can be:

1. Structured
2. Semi-structured
3. Unstructured data

- The data is processed, transformed, and uploaded so that users can access the processed data in the warehouse using Business Intelligence tools, SQL clients, and spreadsheets.
- Merging all this information at a single place can help organizations analyze their customers, etc.

## Types of Data Warehouses

1. Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).
2. Operational Data Store
3. Data Mart

## Components of Data Warehouses

There are four components of a Data Warehouse:

1. **Load Manager**
   - Performs all the operations associated with the extraction and loading of data to a warehouse.
   - These operations can include transformations to prepare the data for entry into the warehouse.

2. **Warehouse Manager**
   - Warehouse Manager performs operations related to the management of the data in a warehouse.
   - It performs operations like the analysis of data to ensure consistency, creation of indexes, generation of denormalization, and aggregations.

3. **Query Manager**
   - Query Manager is also known as a backend component. It performs all the operations related to the management of user queries.
   - The operations of the query manager involve direct queries to the appropriate tables for scheduling the execution of queries.

4. **End-User Access Tools**
   - Data Reporting.
   - Query tools.
   - Application development tools.
   - Data mining tools.

## Who Needs Data Warehouses?

1. Decision-makers.
2. People who want simple technology to access the data.
3. Essential for those who want a systematic approach to making decisions.
4. If the user wants fast performance on a huge amount of data, which is necessary for reports, grids, or charts.
